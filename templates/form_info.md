- **Domain Registration (RDAP)**: Checks when the domain was first registered and the last registration updated.
- **SSL Certificates**: Reviews historical SSL certificate data from certificate transparency logs
- **Last Modified Headers**: Examines timestamps on images embedded in a webpage

Select your preferred analysis method using the radio buttons above. For most comprehensive results, leave **"All Analysis Types"** selected.
